Task types: 
	cyclic:
		CODESYS processes the task in cycles. The cycle time of the task is defined in the input field
		param: - interval (example: t#20ms)
	event:	
		CODESYS starts processing the task as soon as the global variable defined in the input field Event contains a rising edge. 
		param: - event (example: ST_TEST.input1)
	freewheeling:
		CODESYS starts processing the task again automatically in a continuous loop at program start and at the end of a complete pass. Cycle time is not defined.
		param: - NO PARAM REQ
	status:
		CODESYS starts task processing if the variable defined in the Event input field yields the Boolean value TRUE.
		param: - event (example: ST_TEST.input1)
